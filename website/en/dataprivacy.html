    <h3>1. General information about data processing</h3>
    <h4>1.1 Scope of the processing of personal data</h4>
    <p>
      We process the personal data of our users only to the extent necessary to provide a functioning website as well as our content and services. The processing of personal data of our users is only permitted if this is necessary for the provision of a functional website and our contents and services.
      Users regularly only take place with the consent of the user. An exception applies in those cases in which it is not possible to obtain prior consent for actual reasons and the processing of the data by
      is permitted by law.
    </p>
    <h4>1.2 Legal basis for the processing of personal data</h4>
    <p>

      Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b DSGVO serves as a legal basis for the processing of personal data required for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party. This also applies to
      Processing operations that are necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures.<br />
      If the processing of personal data is necessary to fulfil a legal obligation to which our company is subject, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c DSGVO serves as the legal basis.<br />
      In the event that vital interests of the data subject or another natural person necessitate the processing of personal data, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. d DSGVO serves as a legal basis.<br />
      If the processing is necessary to safeguard a legitimate interest of our company or a third party and if the interests, fundamental rights and fundamental freedoms of the person concerned do not outweigh the first-mentioned interest, Art.
      6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO serves as legal basis for the processing.
    </p>
    <h4>1.3 Data erasure and storage time</h4>
    <p>
      The personal data of the person concerned will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose of storage no longer applies. Storage may also take place if this is required by European or national law in the following cases
      Union regulations, laws or other rules to which the person responsible is subject have been laid down. The data will also be blocked or deleted if any of the data required by the above-mentioned standards is not used.
      storage period expires, unless there is a necessity for further storage of the data for the conclusion of a contract or fulfilment of a contract.
